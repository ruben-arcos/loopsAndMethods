# loopsAndMethods
#Complete each of the following exercises:

1. Use a do...while loop to console.log the numbers from 1 to 1000.

2. Create an object (with keys and values) called person with the following data:
    a. firstName: "Jane",
    b. lastName: "Doe",
    c. birthDate: "Jan 5, 1925",
    d. gender: "female"

3. Create a function that logs out the keys of the object using Object.keys().

4. Create a function that logs out the keys and values of the object using Object.entries().

5. Create an arrayOfPersons that contains multiple "people" objects. You can simply copy/paste the person object you made above multiple times. Feel free to change the values to reflect multiple people you might have in your database.

6. Create a function that uses a for...of loop and an if statement to console.logthe value associated with the key birthDate of each object if the birth year is an odd number.

7. Use .map() to map over the arrayOfPersons and console.log() their information.

8. Use .filter() to filter the persons array and console.log 0only males in the array.

9. Create a function that returns true if the value of birthDate is before Jan 1, 1990.

10. Use .filter() to filter the persons array and console.log only people that were born before Jan 1, 1990.

BONUS - Create a function that returns true if the date passed to it is >= 21 years in the past.

BONUS - .filter() out the people in the array who are younger than 21.
